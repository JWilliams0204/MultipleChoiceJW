# MultipleChoiceJW

I created a multiple choice quiz, using javascript, html and css. I created a css page to style the font, and to make the phrase of how many you got correct, visible. I created the javascript with if statements to make the multiple choice work and be effective. It's reason why the whole website works. The html hold the buttons, divs and form tag that i used.
